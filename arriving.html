                    <h3>Dear passengers!</h3>
                    <p>The issuance of entry visas at the National Airport is carried out by the Department for the Entry of Foreigners of the General Consular Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Working hours - around the clock.</p>
                    <p>Visa support documents (the original of the application, as well as its copy) are submitted in advance: for short-term and long-term entry visas - no later than 2 working days before the expected date of arrival of the foreigner.</p>
                    <h3>Attention!</h3>
                    <p>On the copy of the submitted document of visa support, the employee of the UVV of the Main Directorate of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, accepting applications, puts a mark in the form of a stamp, which confirms the fact of acceptance of visa support documents.</p>                    
                    <p>The presence of this mark is a mandatory requirement imposed by air carriers when registering for a flight for foreign citizens who do not have valid visas.</p>
                    <p>Due to a serious illness or death of a close relative or family member of a foreigner, visa support documents may be submitted at the time of submission of the documents necessary for consideration of an application for an entry visa.</p>
